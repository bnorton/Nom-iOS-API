Customer need: Connect with people that connect with you.   
  Allow the owners of local establishments to talk back to 
  their user base and, give them deals and encourage loayalty 
  and repeat business.
User need : Recommend and be recommended places and things to do.
How Nom Solves this: We have built a recommendation engine for telling 
  our users what are the best bet spots right around where they are, 
  and built a engagement platform for our customers to connect back 
  to their users.
